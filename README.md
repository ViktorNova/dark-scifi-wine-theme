# dark-scifi-wine-theme
A dark and sexy flat blue/black color scheme for WINE (probably works on Windows too)
I made this to make working with WINE less painful (which mainly involves running Reaper), and to integrate into the rest of my desktop.

##To install
Simply clone the repo and run ````regedit viktornova-dark-scifi-wine-theme.reg````
Note that this will overwrite your current WINE color scheme

Please let me know if there are any issues with colors in specific apps, etc!



Also, if you want to improve the font rendering in wine, run the included ````winefontssmoothing_en```` script and choose option 3

The font smoothing script was written by Igor Tarasov, and was taken from here:
